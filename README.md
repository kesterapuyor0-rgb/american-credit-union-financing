# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

View your app in AI Studio: https://ai.studio/apps/f9e494df-9bc9-4253-8861-31f5087a4bf5

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`

## MongoDB Atlas and Vercel

The Express API stores users, accounts, transactions, verification codes, and audit logs in MongoDB Atlas through Mongoose. Set `MONGO_URI` in `.env.local` for local development and in the Vercel project environment variables for deployment. Use an Atlas database user with access limited to this application's database.

To provision the first administrator in a new database, set both `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the environment before the first API request. The password is hashed before it is stored. These values are only used to create the administrator if that email does not already exist.

Vercel serves the Vite build from `dist` and sends `/api/*` requests to the serverless Express function in `api/index.ts`. The MongoDB connection is cached across warm function invocations; each request waits for the connection before running an API route.

The previous local `bank.sqlite` file is no longer read or modified, and its records are not imported automatically. Export and migrate any data you need before relying on the Atlas database.

## Customer enrollment review

The two-step enrollment process collects a customer profile, a verification reference, and supporting document file details. The browser does not upload document contents; MongoDB stores the verification reference and selected-file metadata (filename, MIME type, and size). Customers should not enter a Social Security number or select an actual identity document, and should contact customer support to complete registration.

New enrollments are saved in MongoDB with an `under_review` status. After submitting, customers are instructed to contact `americancreditunion.financing@gmail.com` to complete registration. Customers can sign in to see the account-under-review screen, but banking APIs and the dashboard remain unavailable until an administrator approves the account. The status screen refreshes periodically so an approval grants access without requiring another sign-in. Administrators can set customer enrollment statuses to `under_review`, `approved`, or `rejected` (a reason is required for rejection) under **Enrollment review**; changes are added to the audit log. Existing accounts without a verification status remain usable for backward compatibility.
